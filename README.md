# About VoxWorld

Voxworld is an under development game framework for a 2d minecraft like game in web browser. I created this project in order to learn 2d canvas game engine design and development skill. Its a total new interesting things for me to explore.. By reading varied marterials from books and internet, I practiced lots of ideas of how to create a game from just drawing pixels on a screen.
